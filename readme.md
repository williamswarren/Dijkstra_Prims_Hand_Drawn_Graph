# Dijkstras & Prims MST On A Hand-Drawn Graph

*The purpose of this project is to take a hand drawn graph on scratch paper and use computer vision to interpret the various vertices, edges and associated weights*

## Sample Input

![Hand Drawn Graph](./graphviz_images/test_graph.png)

## Sample Output

![Graph](./graphviz_images/adjacency_list.png)
![Digital Graph](./graphviz_images/Graph_graphviz.png)
![Shortest Path](./graphviz_images/SP_graphviz.png)
![MST](./graphviz_images/MST_graphviz.png)

**Libraries used so far - OpenCV (will update and add requirements.txt accordingly)**
